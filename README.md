# Routed Gothic

A clean implementation of a common lettering style found on technical
drawings, engraved office signs, computer and typewriter keyboards,
and some comic books and avionics from the mid-20th century.

It’s ugly, and therein lies its beauty.

I created this font by purchasing a Leroy Lettering set, using
Inkscape to trace the scanned letterforms of one of its templates, and
some FontForge Python scripting.

Other keywords I want people to use to find this font include: Wrico.

## Notes

The “italic” fonts of this typeface are literally slanted 22.5°, as a
drafter would do.

The “half italic” fonts of this typeface are slanted 11.25°, as seen
in a small number of vintage drawings.

There are no hints, as I originally created this font for a project
intended to be printed at a sufficiently high resolution to obviate
them. I might make hints later though.

Routed Gothic is now distributed under the terms of the

## Coverage

Every ASCII character, ISO Latin 1, much of Unicode’s General
Punctuation block for common typographic symbols, and then some.
